  <h1>Welcome to model-recycling page</h1>
  <p> Hardly anyone trains from scratch anymore, we all finetune over a pretrained model. Research is slowly reaches consensus that some finetuned models are better base models than the pretrained models themselves. This site presents a dynamic view of the best models to choose, given that you chose the model's size and architecture.</p>
  <p> We rank finetuned models found in HuggingFace per architecture. We efficiently check each model and test the best by full finetuning over 36 target tasks.</p>
