# Model Recycling
Welcome to the model recycling github.
To see the best model to start from, or study the differences between finetuned models, please visit the [website](https://ibm.github.io/model-recycling/). Or read the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00107).

Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or suggestions.
## Code
We provide code to fuse models following this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15020), which offers an advancement over just intertaining. Instead of recycling one model, one can use several. The paper also explains when is it better than intertraining and when not.
