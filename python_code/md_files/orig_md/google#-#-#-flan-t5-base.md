# TL;DR

If you already know T5, FLAN-T5 is just better at everything. For the same number of parameters, these models have been fine-tuned on more than 1000 additional tasks covering also more languages. 
As mentioned in the first few lines of the abstract : 
>  Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints,1 which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.

# Uses

## Direct Use and Downstream Use

The authors write in [the original paper's model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) that: 

> The primary use is research on language models, including: research on zero-shot NLP tasks and in-context few-shot learning NLP tasks, such as reasoning, and question answering; advancing fairness and safety research, and understanding limitations of current large language models

See the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) for further details.

# Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The information below in this section are copied from the model's [official model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):

> Language models, including Flan-T5, can potentially be used for language generation in a harmful way, according to Rae et al. (2021). Flan-T5 should not be used directly in any application, without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application.

## Ethical considerations and risks

> Flan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. As a result the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating equivalently inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases in the underlying data.

## Known Limitations

> Flan-T5 has not been tested in real world applications.

## Sensitive Use:

> Flan-T5 should not be applied for any unacceptable use cases, e.g., generation of abusive speech.

# Training Details

## Training Data

The model was trained on a mixture of tasks, that includes the tasks described in the table below (from the original paper, figure 2):

![table.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1666363265279-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)


## Training Procedure

According to the model card from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):

> These models are based on pretrained T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and fine-tuned with instructions for better zero-shot and few-shot performance. There is one fine-tuned Flan model per T5 model size.

The model has been trained on TPU v3 or TPU v4 pods, using [`t5x`](https://github.com/google-research/t5x) codebase together with [`jax`](https://github.com/google/jax).


# Evaluation

## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics
